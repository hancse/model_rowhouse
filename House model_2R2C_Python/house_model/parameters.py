# It is possible to choose between light, middle or heavy weight constructionIt is assumed that furniture and the surface part of the walls have the same temperature as the air and the wall mass is divided between the air and wall mass. Thus, the capacity of the air node consists of the air capacity, furniture capacity and capacity of a part of the walls. Appendix I presents the coefficients in the dwelling model. In the resistance Rair_outdoor the influence of heat transmission through the outdoor walls and natural ventilation is considered.
